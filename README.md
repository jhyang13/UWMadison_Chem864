## Project Title: 
The Parameter Reconstruction for Non-Linear Stress-Strain Relations

## Problem Statement: 
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning methods to estimate model parameters based on provided stress-strain curves. 

## Data-Driven Approach:

The machine learning models that have been implemented learn the non-linear stress-strain relationship from training data. In this context, each training sample consists of vector-valued stresses and strains, which are then associated with the corresponding model parameters. 

To achieve this, the following data split is suggested:

*   **features (vector-valued):** $\varepsilon$, $\sigma$
*   **labels:** $C$, $n$ based on the **Ramberg-Osgood model** or the 10 parameters based on the **Constitutive model**

## Model Requirements:

**1. Incorporation of noise in stress-strain curves to emulate experimental data:** Real-world experimental data often contain inherent noise due to various factors like measurement inaccuracies or environmental disturbances. To closely mimic these conditions, synthetic noise should be introduced into the stress-strain data used for training the machine learning model. This practice will help in enhancing the model's robustness and its ability to perform accurately on actual experimental data, which invariably includes some degree of noise.

**2. Handling uneven distribution of data points across strain values:** During experimental data collection, data points may not be evenly spaced across strain values. For instance, a higher density of data points might be gathered at lower strains where changes are more nuanced, and fewer at higher strains. The model should be capable of handling such irregularly spaced data points and still deliver precise predictions. This reflects the reality of experimental data acquisition, where sampling rates can vary.

**3. Flexibility in adjusting the number of data points within stress-strain curves:** Depending on the experimental setup and the material tested, the number of data points obtained from stress-strain curves may vary. The predictive model must be adaptable enough to work with stress-strain curves that have variable numbers of data points. It must not rely on a fixed input size but should be able to process sequences of arbitrary lengths. This requirement can be met by employing methods such as time series analysis or recurrent neural networks that are well-suited for input of variable lengths.

## Solution Procedure:

* Analyze an exemplary stress-strain curve
* Generating apropriate test and train data
* Implement a machine learning model
* Training the model and optimize hyperparameter
* Evaluate the generalization performance on the test data

## Compilation and Execution Instructions:

To successfully compile and run the code for the results reported in this project, follow these steps:

- **Environment Setup:** Ensure you have Python installed with the necessary libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook. Optionally, for deep learning parts, TensorFlow or PyTorch should be installed.
- **Running the Notebooks:** Open Jupyter Notebook in the project root directory. Navigate to the desired notebook (.ipynb files) and open it. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the results.
- **Using the Scripts:** The Python scripts (plotlabels.py, plotstandards.py) are used within the notebooks. Ensure they are in the same directory as the notebooks for proper execution.
- **Data and Resources:** The /resources directory should contain all necessary datasets before running the notebooks.

## Additional Information:

Ensure that all dependencies and libraries are installed in your Python environment. The notebooks are self-contained and should run in a standard scientific Python environment.
