Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5

NOTE 1 [file unknown]:
  You are using constraints on all bonds, whereas the forcefield has been
  parametrized only with constraints involving hydrogen atoms. We suggest
  using constraints = h-bonds instead, this will also improve performance.

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 42.00

NOTE 2 [file /home/jyang753/project4/S2_REMD/mdp/nvt_8.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.
